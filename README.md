# NFA and DFA
implementation of a deterministic and Nondeterministic finite automaton, and given an NFA, it can be converted to DFA.

# Test files provided 
Two test files are in this repo which are nfa.in and nfain1.in in which each line represent a part in the NFA, first line describes the states seperated by a comma, second line has the accept states seperated by a comma, third is the alphabets of the language seperated by a comma, then the start state, followed by transitions which are seperated by a '#' and has the format : "from,to,alphabet" , and finally the inputs to this automaton.
